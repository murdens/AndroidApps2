# Android Apps

<strong>Overview</strong>

I'm on my 100 Days of Code journey. At day 60 I started Udacity Basic Android Development courses.

This repo is a collection of work from those courses with other self developed projects.  Many of the indiviual projects have their own READme.

# Examples:
- AnimalInstincts : SQLite database
- BookEnds : Google Books API, loader, Glide.
- Quaked : Earthquake USGS API, loader.
- Miwok : MediaPlayer/audiomanager
- Omens : Simple app with rotation animation
- Trivia : Shared prefs, Volley.
- NoDo : Room, LiveData & ViewModel
