# Android Studio My First App tutorial

<strong>Overview</strong>

- Create simple app with text input box and submit button, returns list view when submitted.

I had significant problems with set up of Android Studio due to space limitations on VM.  
Finally set up and found CPU did not support VT-x so could not use Android emulator.
Read through numerous articles, help forums and landed on Genymotion cloud SaaS as an option.
Upload apk to cloud emulator.
I am finding both Android studio and the Genymotion emulator slow due to limited RAM on VM.

After a challening set up I was pleased to be able to see this mini basic app in action.
